## Next.js learning ##

I made this little project following [Next.js's documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) in order to get a basic understanding of the framework.

## Project in action ##

Just clone this repo and type `npm run dev` or `npm dev` and then go into your browser and enter this url [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000/)
