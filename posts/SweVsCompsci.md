This debate is a pretty common one for undergradute students: which one to choose between **Software Engineering** and **Computer Science**

## Computer Science ##

CompSci studies computation and information. Some common subjects are computability, algorithms and data structures, complexity, software and hardware desing, compilers, among other things. For example, in computer science you can study if a problem is computable, in other words if a problem can be solved using a computer. 

## Software Engineering ##

SwE it's the application of engineering methodologies and techniques to the process of software development. It relies heavily on theoric concepts from computer science while adding more business related concepts like budget, client/user requirements, schedules and more.

## Main Differences ##

SwE and CompSci share the same ADN, both have a relationship like Math and physics have a relationship with Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. On one hand CompSci can be a lot more broad that SwE, there are a lot of topics that are not pretty relevant to a SwE like machine learning or computability. SwE is much more specific to working environments while CompSci is an exact science, it's very common that researchers in the field of computing are computer scientists.
